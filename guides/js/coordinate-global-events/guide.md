# Coordinating Global Events with Temporal

Scheduling events across different time zones is notoriously difficult with the legacy `Date` object, especially around Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions when hours can be skipped or repeated.

The `Temporal` API provides `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` to represent a date and time in a specific time zone, handling DST transitions automatically and predictably.

## How to Implement

To coordinate global events and handle potential DST conflicts:

1. **Create a ZonedDateTime**: Use `Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from()` to create a time-zone-aware date-time object.
2. **Handle Ambiguity**: Use the `disambiguation` option to control behavior when a time is ambiguous or does not exist (e.g., during clock changes).
3. **Convert Time Zones**: Use `.withTimeZone()` to see the equivalent time in another location.

### Example: Scheduling and Conflict Detection

```javascript
// 1. Define the event time and target time zone
const date = "2025-03-09";
const time = "02:30"; // This time is skipped in New York during Spring Forward
const timeZone = "America/New_York";
const inputStr = `${date}T${time}[${timeZone}]`;

// 2. Resolve the time safely using 'compatible' (default)
// 'compatible' will resolve to a valid time even if skipped or repeated.
// Parsing here first means a malformed input string throws now, so the
// conflict check below cannot mistake it for a DST conflict.
const hostTime = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(inputStr, { disambiguation: 'compatible' });
console.log(`Resolved time: ${hostTime.toString()}`);

// 3. Detect conflicts using 'reject'
let hasConflict = false;
try {
  // 'reject' throws RangeError if the time is ambiguous or does not exist
  Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(inputStr, { disambiguation: 'reject' });
} catch (e) {
  // The input already parsed above, so a RangeError here is a DST gap or
  // overlap. Rethrow any other error instead of swallowing it.
  if (!(e instanceof RangeError)) throw e;
  hasConflict = true;
  console.log("This time falls in a DST transition gap or overlap.");
}

// 4. Convert to another time zone (e.g., Tokyo)
const tokyoTime = hostTime.withTimeZone("Asia/Tokyo");
console.log(`Tokyo time: ${tokyoTime.toString()}`);
```

## Strategic Implementation & Best Practices

-   **DO** use `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` for events that are bound to a specific geographical location (like a meeting in a specific city).
-   **DO** use `disambiguation: 'reject'` if you need to detect and warn users about scheduling conflicts during DST transitions.
-   **DO** use `disambiguation: 'compatible'` (the default) when you want the system to automatically pick a sensible time when conflicts occur.
-   **DO NOT** use `Temporal.PlainDateTime` for global events, as it does not carry time zone information and cannot account for DST changes.
-   **DO** use `.withTimeZone()` to calculate the equivalent time in other locations without mutating the original object (Temporal objects are immutable).
