- The implementation MUST feature-detect the `Temporal` API before usage to ensure compatibility.
- The implementation MUST conditionally load a Temporal polyfill only if native support is absent.
- The implementation MUST run its Temporal-dependent startup logic only after `Temporal` is available, in both browsers with native support and browsers that load the polyfill.
- The implementation MUST ensure the Temporal API is available globally if the application logic relies on the global `Temporal` object.
- The implementation MUST use `Temporal.PlainDate` for capturing calendar dates (such as birthdates, anniversaries, or holidays) where the specific time of day or time zone is irrelevant.
- The implementation MUST use `Temporal.PlainTime` for capturing wall-clock times (such as a daily alarm or reminder) where the time should remain constant regardless of the user's time zone.
- The implementation MUST NOT use `Temporal.PlainDate` or `Temporal.PlainTime` for data that represents a specific moment in physical time (an instant).
- The implementation MUST NOT attempt to modify `Temporal` instances directly, as they are immutable.
