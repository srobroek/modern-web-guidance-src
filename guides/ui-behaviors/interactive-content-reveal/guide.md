# Interactive Content Reveal

Add performant, interactive reveal effects to your site with CSS masks and registered custom properties. By using a radial gradient as a mask and registering its stop values, we can smoothly transition the entry and exit, while following a user's pointer with minimal JavaScript. 

## Implementation

### 1. Register Custom Properties
To enable smooth interpolation of gradient stop values, you must register the variables using `@property`. This informs the browser's engine about the data type, allowing it to transition between values during updates.

```css
/* Register the spotlight inner and outer sizes to enable interpolation */
 @property --inner-size{
  syntax: "<length-percentage>";
  inherits: true;
  initial-value: 0px;
}
@property --outer-size{
  syntax: "<length-percentage>";
  inherits: true;
  initial-value: 0px;
}
```

The custom properties tracking the pointer position do not need to be transitioned, so it is not required to register them. Give them a `var()` fallback, though: until the first `pointermove` they are undefined, which makes the whole `mask-image` invalid at computed-value time, so it falls back to `none` and shows the entire layer.

### 2. Define the Masking Layer
Apply the `mask-image` to the element you want to reveal. Use a `radial-gradient` that references the registered properties.

```css
.reveal-layer {
  /* Only transition the size properties, NOT the position variables */
  transition: --inner-size 0.2s ease-in-out, --outer-size 0.2s ease-in-out;  

  /* The spotlight is the opaque (black) center of the mask; the transparent rest hides the layer */
  mask-image: radial-gradient(
    circle at var(--mouse-x, 50%) var(--mouse-y, 50%),
    black var(--inner-size, 0%),
    transparent var(--outer-size, 0%)
  );

  /* Ensure the mask doesn't repeat if the element is large */
  mask-repeat: no-repeat;

  /* Make the mask layer non-interactive */
  pointer-events: none;
}

/* Update the gradient stops on interaction. Trigger from the container:
   with pointer-events: none, .reveal-layer itself never matches :hover. */
.container:is(:hover, :focus-within) .reveal-layer {
  --inner-size: 100px;
  --outer-size: 120px;
}
```

### 3. Update Coordinates with JavaScript
Track the pointer position and update the CSS variables. Only the size properties are registered and transitioned, so the spotlight follows the pointer exactly as often as `pointermove` fires; it grows and shrinks smoothly, but does not glide between positions.

```javascript
const container = document.querySelector('.container');
// Store the container's bounding rect
let rect = container.getBoundingClientRect();
const updateRect = () => {
  rect = container.getBoundingClientRect();
};
// The rect is viewport-relative: refresh it when the container is resized
// and when the page or any ancestor scroller scrolls.
new ResizeObserver(updateRect).observe(container);
document.addEventListener('scroll', updateRect, { capture: true, passive: true });

container.addEventListener('pointermove', (e) => {
  // Calculate position as a percentage of the container.
  const x = ((e.clientX - rect.left) / rect.width) * 100;
  const y = ((e.clientY - rect.top) / rect.height) * 100;

  // Update the (unregistered) position properties
  container.style.setProperty('--mouse-x', `${x}%`);
  container.style.setProperty('--mouse-y', `${y}%`);
});
```

### 4. Accessibility and Interaction
**MANDATORY Accessibility Guarantee:** This pattern relies on pointer interactions to reveal a visual spotlight. You MUST guarantee that all underlying content remains fully visible, legible, and independently keyboard-reachable by default in the underlying layout, using the spotlight layer purely as a non-essential visual enhancement for pointer users. Never use this effect to obscure or gate essential content from keyboard-only or assistive technology users.

* **Pointer Events:** Set `pointer-events: none` on the mask overlay layer to allow standard click and touch interactions to pass through to controls underneath.
* **Reduced Motion Override:** Disable smooth transition interpolation for users requesting reduced motion.

```css
/* MANDATORY Copy-Paste Safety: Disable transition scaling for motion-sensitive users */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .reveal-layer {
    transition: none !important;
  }
}
```

## Fallback strategies

{{ FEATURE_FALLBACKS("registered-custom-properties") }}

### Non-registered Property Fallback
Browsers that support `mask-image` but not `@property` will still show the spotlight, but the movement will jump between on and off states because they cannot interpolate values inside a `radial-gradient`. Provide fallback values when using `var()`.

```css
.reveal-layer {
  mask-image: radial-gradient(
    circle at var(--mouse-x, 50%) var(--mouse-y, 50%),
    /* Use fallback values when using the `var()` function for browsers that don't get an initial value from the @property registration. */
    black var(--inner-size, 0%),
    transparent var(--outer-size, 0%)
  );
}
```

### Basic Mask Support

For browsers that do not support CSS masking at all:
1. **Prefixed property:** Use the `-webkit-mask-image` prefixed property for broader browser support.
2. **Progressive Enhancement:** Design the base state of the UI to be fully functional and legible without the reveal effect. This is useful when the effect is only adds visual flair, and not a requirement for reading content.
