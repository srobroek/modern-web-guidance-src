# Creating a stagger animation

Stagger animations provide an interesting effect where multiple ordered elements animate sequentially with a slight delay between each, rather than all animating at once. This technique is often used in lists, galleries, or navigation menus to guide the user's eye and add a polished, rhythmic feel to interactions.

## Stagger animations with `sibling-index()`

Use the `sibling-index()` property on the `animation-delay` property so that the animation on each element is offset by a number proportionate to their position in their parent. The `sibling-index()` function returns an integer, so it must be multiplied by a time unit to convert it to a time.

```css
#stagger-list > .item {
  --stagger-time: 0.1s;
  /* Define the animation first */
  animation: fade-in 0.4s;
  /* Set the `animation-delay` to a time multiplied by the `sibling-index()` */
  animation-delay: calc(sibling-index() * var(--stagger-time))
}
```

**MANDATORY:** Respect user preferences by disabling the animation for users who prefer reduced motion. 

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce){
  /* Disable animation for users who prefer reduced motion. */
  #stagger-list > .item {
    animation: none;
  }
}
```

## Fallback strategies

{{ BASELINE_STATUS("sibling-count") }}

Test for support for `sibling-index()` using CSS with `@supports (animation-delay: calc(sibling-index() * 0.1s)){}` or JavaScript with `!CSS.supports('animation-delay: calc(sibling-index() * 0.1s)')`.

To support stagger animations in older browsers, use JavaScript to add a `--sibling-index` custom property to each sibling element. MANDATORY: wrap this in a `CSS.supports('animation-delay: calc(sibling-index() * 0.1s)')` test to avoid running unneeded JavaScript.

```js
if(!CSS.supports('animation-delay: calc(sibling-index() * 0.1s)')){
  const staggerList = document.getElementById('stagger-list');
  [...staggerList.children].forEach((el, index)=>el.style.setProperty('--sibling-index', index + 1));
}
```

Add an `animation-delay` declaration that uses the `--sibling-index` custom property, and override it with the `sibling-index()` declaration only inside `@supports`. MANDATORY: do not rely on declaration order alone. Because the `sibling-index()` declaration also contains `var()`, older browsers do not reject it at parse time; it wins the cascade, becomes invalid at computed-value time, and resets `animation-delay` to `0s`, so the fallback never staggers.

```css
#stagger-list > .item {
  animation-delay: calc(var(--sibling-index) * var(--stagger-time));
}

@supports (animation-delay: calc(sibling-index() * 0.1s)) {
  #stagger-list > .item {
    animation-delay: calc(sibling-index() * var(--stagger-time));
  }
}
```
