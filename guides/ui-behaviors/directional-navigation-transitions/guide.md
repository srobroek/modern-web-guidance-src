# Directional Navigation Transitions

Single Page Applications (SPAs) provide the appearance of navigation by replacing the content of the page without navigating to a new page. By default, the content is simply replaced, without any transitions. Directional transitions can visually reinforce a spatial relationship between views. 

By sliding new content in from the direction the user is moving you create a mental map of the application structure. For instance, a product site may show a transition to the right for "forward," and to the left for "back", or a slideshow may transition up and down to show next and previous slides.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Detect Navigation Direction**: Determine if the user is moving "forward" or "backward" in the application flow. How you detect the direction depends on your use case.
2. **Trigger Transition with Types**: Pass the direction in a `types` array to `document.startViewTransition()` to categorize the transition.
3. **Define Directional Animations with CSS**: Use the `:active-view-transition-type()` pseudo-class to apply specific animations based on the navigation type.

### Defining Keyframes

Define sliding animations to and from each direction. For best performance, animate position changes using the `transform` property or the individual transform properties, `scale`, `rotate`, and `translate`. `opacity` is generally performant as well, but avoid animating other CSS properties without first verifying that they don't trigger layout or painting.

```css
/* Slide an element out to the left */
@keyframes slide-to-left {
  /* Mandatory: animate `transform` instead of inset properties for better performance. */
  to { transform: translateX(-100%); }
}

/* Slide an element in from the right */
@keyframes slide-from-right {
  from { transform: translateX(100%); }
}

/* Slide an element out to the right */
@keyframes slide-to-right {
  to { transform: translateX(100%); }
}

/* Slide an element in from the left */
@keyframes slide-from-left {
  from { transform: translateX(-100%); }
}
```

### Set up shared animation settings

Use the `::view-transition-group(root)` selector to apply animation settings that are shared across all transitions.

```css
::view-transition-group(root){
  animation: 0.4s ease-in-out both;
}
```

### Applying Directional Animations

Use the `active-view-transition-type` pseudo-class to target the transition views specifically when the "forward" or "backward" type is active.

```css
/* MANDATORY: Apply forward animations when the 'forward' type is active */
html:active-view-transition-type(forward)::view-transition-old(root) {
  animation-name: slide-to-left;
}
html:active-view-transition-type(forward)::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation-name: slide-from-right;
}

/* MANDATORY: Apply backward animations when the 'backward' type is active */
html:active-view-transition-type(backward)::view-transition-old(root) {
  animation-name: slide-to-right;
}
html:active-view-transition-type(backward)::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation-name: slide-from-left;
}
```

### Triggering the Transition

When navigating, pass the appropriate type to the `startViewTransition` method.

```javascript
const transitionType = yourTransitionTypeLogic();
const updateDOM = yourUpdateDOMLogic();

document.startViewTransition({
  update: updateDOM,
  types: [transitionType] // Matches the CSS :active-view-transition-type() selectors
});
```


### Accessibility

Always respect user preferences for reduced motion by disabling or simplifying animations.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  ::view-transition-group(root) {
    animation: none !important;
  }
}
```

### Fallback strategies

{{ BASELINE_STATUS("view-transitions") }}
{{ BASELINE_STATUS("active-view-transition") }}

The View Transitions API is a progressive enhancement. In unsupported browsers, `document.startViewTransition` will be `undefined`. You must wrap your navigation logic in a feature detection check to ensure the DOM update still occurs immediately without animation, as shown in this helper function.

Transition types arrived later than the API itself: browsers that have `startViewTransition()` but not types (Chrome and Edge 111-124, Safari 18.0-18.1) only accept a callback, so passing them the options object throws a `TypeError` and the DOM update never runs. Detect types through `ViewTransition.prototype.types` and fall back to the callback form, which gives those browsers the default cross-fade.

```javascript
/**
 * Navigates to a new view with a directional transition.
 * @param {Function} updateDOM - Callback to update the DOM state.
 * @param {string} direction - Either 'forward' or 'backward'.
 */
function navigate(updateDOM, direction) {
  // Feature detect for browsers that do not support View Transitions
  if (!document.startViewTransition) {
    updateDOM();
    return;
  }

  // Browsers without transition types reject the options object
  if (!('types' in ViewTransition.prototype)) {
    document.startViewTransition(updateDOM);
    return;
  }

  // Start transition with the specific navigation type
  document.startViewTransition({
    update: updateDOM,
    types: [direction] // Matches the CSS :active-view-transition-type() selectors
  });
}
```
