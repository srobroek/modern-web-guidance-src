# Scrollytelling

Scrollytelling is a popular technique used to create engaging and immersive web experiences. It involves animating elements on a page as the user scrolls, effectively telling a story or guiding the user through a narrative. With CSS Scroll-Driven Animations, you can create these effects directly in CSS, without needing to rely on JavaScript. The animations are controlled by the scroll position, not a time-based clock, which ensures they are always in sync with the user's scroll.

## How to implement

To create a scrollytelling experience, you need two sets of elements: one to track the scroll position and another to be animated.

First, define a named `view-timeline` on the elements you want to track. These will act as the drivers for your animations.

```css
#tracked {
  section:nth-child(1){ view-timeline: --tl-1 block; }
  section:nth-child(2){ view-timeline: --tl-2 block; }
  section:nth-child(3){ view-timeline: --tl-3 block; }
  section:nth-child(4){ view-timeline: --tl-4 block; }
  section:nth-child(5){ view-timeline: --tl-5 block; }
}
```

Next, apply animations to the elements you want to animate and link them to the timelines you just created using the `animation-timeline` property.

```css
#animated {
  section {
    animation: animate-in auto linear both, animate-out auto linear forwards;
    animation-range: entry 25% cover 50%, exit 50% exit 75%;
  }

  section:nth-child(1){ animation-timeline: --tl-1; }
  section:nth-child(2){ animation-timeline: --tl-2; }
  section:nth-child(3){ animation-timeline: --tl-3; }
  section:nth-child(4){ animation-timeline: --tl-4; }
  section:nth-child(5){ animation-timeline: --tl-5; }
}
```

For the `animation-timeline` to be able to reference the named timelines, they need to be in the same scope. You can use the `timeline-scope` property on a common ancestor to make the timelines available to all the elements that need them. The `:root` element is often a good choice for this.

```css
html {
  timeline-scope: --tl-1, --tl-2, --tl-3, --tl-4, --tl-5;
}
```

Finally, you can use the `animation-range` property to specify the exact range of the timeline during which the animation should run. This gives you fine-grained control over when the animations are triggered and how they progress.

```css
#animated section {
  animation-range: entry 25% cover 50%, exit 50% exit 75%;
}
```

## Example code

The animations only run when the user has not asked for reduced motion and the browser fully supports scroll-driven animations. Without the `@supports` guard, a browser that accepts `animation-duration: auto` but has no scroll timelines (for example, Safari 18.4 to 18.x) runs both animations against the document timeline, where `auto` means `0s`, and the `forwards` fill of `animate-out` leaves every section at `opacity: 0`.

```css
html {
  timeline-scope: --tl-1, --tl-2, --tl-3, --tl-4, --tl-5;
}

#tracked {
  section:nth-child(1){ view-timeline: --tl-1 block; }
  section:nth-child(2){ view-timeline: --tl-2 block; }
  section:nth-child(3){ view-timeline: --tl-3 block; }
  section:nth-child(4){ view-timeline: --tl-4 block; }
  section:nth-child(5){ view-timeline: --tl-5 block; }
}

/* MANDATORY Copy-Paste Safety: only animate for users who have not asked for reduced motion,
   in browsers with full scroll-driven animation support */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  @supports ((animation-timeline: scroll()) and (animation-range: 0% 100%)) {
    @keyframes animate-in {
      from { scale: 0.5; opacity: 0; transform: rotateY(-180deg); }
      to { transform: rotateY(0deg); }
    }
    @keyframes animate-out {
      to { translate: 100% 0; opacity: 0; }
    }

    #animated {
      section {
        animation: animate-in auto linear both, animate-out auto linear forwards;
        animation-range: entry 25% cover 50%, exit 50% exit 75%;
        backface-visibility: hidden;
      }

      section:nth-child(1){ animation-timeline: --tl-1; }
      section:nth-child(2){ animation-timeline: --tl-2; }
      section:nth-child(3){ animation-timeline: --tl-3; }
      section:nth-child(4){ animation-timeline: --tl-4; }
      section:nth-child(5){ animation-timeline: --tl-5; }
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

When using scroll-driven animations, it's important to follow a few best practices to ensure a smooth and accessible experience:

- **DO** include feature detection: Not all browsers support scroll-driven animations. Use `@supports ((animation-timeline: scroll()) and (animation-range: 0% 100%))` to check for support and provide a fallback for browsers that don't support it.
  - The `(animation-range: 0% 100%)` check **MUST** be included here, to filter out browsers with only partial support.
  - **DO NOT** use the `scroll-timeline-polyfill` package for the fallback strategy as it is not feature complete and has a lot of known issues.
  - If the animation is only considered to be decorative, opt for Progressive Enhancement and **DO NOT** provide a fallback.
- **DO** respect user preferences: Some users prefer to have less motion on the web. Use the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable or reduce your animations for these users.
- **DO** try to animate only performant CSS properties: For the smoothest animations, stick to animating properties that can be handled by the browser's compositor thread, such as `transform` and `opacity`. Animating other properties like `width` or `height` can lead to performance issues.
- **DO** use the correct declaration order: When using the `animation` shorthand property, declare `animation-timeline` and `animation-range` *after* it to prevent the shorthand from resetting the timeline.

When using the `view-timeline` property to create a scroll-driven animation:

- **DO** use a CSS `<dashed-ident>` for the name.
- **OPTIONAL** be explicit about the axis to track: When not targeting the default `block` axis (such as in a horizontal scroller), be explicit about which axis to track with `view-timeline-axis`.
- **DO** make sure the scope of the lookup works: When the element that is declaring the `view-timeline` is not a flat tree ancestor of the animated element, hoist up the visibility of the `view-timeline`’s name by using `timeline-scope` on a shared ancestor.

## Fallback strategies

{{ FEATURE_FALLBACKS("scroll-driven-animations") }}

For browsers that do not support scroll-driven animations, you can use a fallback to recreate the visual effects. The fallbacks are typically built with either a scroll listener (for ScrollTimeline effects) or the IntersectionObserver API (for ViewTimeline effects).

In browsers with built-in support for scroll-driven animations, ALWAYS use the native CSS implementation as those are more performant.

Note that not every effect can be recreated using the fallbacks approach.

For this use-case specifically, the following script applies the fallback for browsers that do not support scroll-driven animations. It uses an `IntersectionObserver` to track the visibility of each `#tracked section` element and updates the `opacity`, `transform` and `translate` of the corresponding `#animated section` accordingly. It runs only when the native `@supports` condition fails, so the two never compete, and it leaves the sections untouched while the user prefers reduced motion.

```js
const supportsScrollTimelines = CSS.supports(
  '(animation-timeline: scroll()) and (animation-range: 0% 100%)'
);

if (!supportsScrollTimelines) {
  const reduceMotion = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)');
  const trackedSections = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('#tracked section'));
  const animatedSections = document.querySelectorAll('#animated section');

  const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
      const animatedSection = animatedSections[trackedSections.indexOf(entry.target)];
      if (!animatedSection) return;

      // Reduced motion: show the section as-is (the fallback CSS does not hide it either).
      if (reduceMotion.matches) {
        animatedSection.style.removeProperty('opacity');
        animatedSection.style.removeProperty('transform');
        animatedSection.style.removeProperty('translate');
        return;
      }

      const ratio = entry.intersectionRatio;
      // The ratio is the same for a section entering at the bottom and one leaving at
      // the top; its position relative to the viewport tells the two apart.
      const isLeaving = entry.boundingClientRect.top < (entry.rootBounds?.top ?? 0);

      animatedSection.style.opacity = ratio;
      if (isLeaving) {
        // Animate-out: slide away while fading out
        animatedSection.style.transform = 'none';
        animatedSection.style.translate = `${(1 - ratio) * 100}% 0`;
      } else {
        // Animate-in: grow and turn while fading in
        animatedSection.style.transform = `scale(${0.5 + ratio * 0.5}) rotateY(${-180 + ratio * 180}deg)`;
        animatedSection.style.translate = '0 0';
      }
    });
  }, { threshold: Array.from({length: 101}, (_, i) => i / 100) });

  trackedSections.forEach(section => observer.observe(section));

  // When the preference changes, re-observe: each new observation delivers a fresh entry.
  reduceMotion.addEventListener('change', () => {
    trackedSections.forEach(section => {
      observer.unobserve(section);
      observer.observe(section);
    });
  });
}
```

And the accompanying CSS, which sets the starting state only on the fallback path and never for reduced-motion users:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  @supports not ((animation-timeline: scroll()) and (animation-range: 0% 100%)) {
    #animated section {
      opacity: 0;
      transform: scale(0.5)  rotateY(-180deg);
      backface-visibility: hidden;
    }
  }
}
```

This fallback is an approximation, not an equivalent. It maps each tracked section's visible fraction onto the animation instead of the exact `entry 25% cover 50%` and `exit 50% exit 75%` ranges, so the effects start and finish at different scroll positions, and a tracked section taller than the viewport never reaches a ratio of 1, so its counterpart never fully appears.
