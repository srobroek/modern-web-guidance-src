* The agent has defined named `view-timeline`s on the tracked elements.
* The agent has used `timeline-scope` on a common ancestor (e.g., `html` or `:root`) to make the named timelines accessible.
* The agent has applied animations to the target elements using `animation-timeline` linked to the named timelines.
* The agent has used `animation-range` to control the animation timing relative to the tracked elements.
* The implementation includes feature detection using `@supports` for scroll-driven animations (checking `animation-timeline` and `animation-range`), and the animations are declared inside it.
* The implementation respects user preferences for reduced motion using `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`.
