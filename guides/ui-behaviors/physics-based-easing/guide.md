# Physics Based Easing

Traditional CSS easing functions like `ease-in` or `cubic-bezier()` are limited to simple curves, making it impossible to create complex physics-based effects like bounces or springs. The `linear()` timing function solves this by allowing you to provide a series of stops that can approximate complex curves. Transitions and animations are interpolated based on straight lines between the stops, but within enough stops, it can appear smooth.

### Implementation Steps

1.  **Generate the curve stops:**
    Manually plotting dozens of points for a spring or bounce is impractical. Use a timing function from an external library, or use a  tool to convert an existing JavaScript easing function or an SVG path into the `linear()` syntax. Optional: store these timing functions as CSS custom properties for reuse throughout your site.
2.  **Define the timing function:**
    Apply the generated stops to the `transition-timing-function` or `animation-timing-function` property, or through the `transition` or `animation` shorthands.
3.  **Adjust the duration:**
    Unlike JavaScript physics engines where duration is derived from physical properties (mass, stiffness), CSS still requires a fixed `duration`. You may need to adjust the duration to get the intended effect.

### Example: Spring Easing

This example shows how to use a custom `linear()` function to create a spring effect that overshoots the target value before settling.

```css
.spring {
  /* Define the physics-based easing as a reusable variable */
  --spring-easing: linear(0, 0.016 0.5%, 0.06 1%, 0.226 2%, 1.116 5.4%, 1.375 6.6%, 1.527 7.7%, 1.565 8.2%, 1.585 8.8%, 1.581 9.3%, 1.559 9.8%, 1.458 10.9%, 0.937 14.3%, 0.784 15.5%, 0.693 16.6%, 0.67 17.1%, 0.657 17.7%, 0.671 18.7%, 0.729 19.8%, 1.042 23.3%, 1.13 24.5%, 1.182 25.6%, 1.201 26.7%, 1.192 27.7%, 1.156 28.8%, 0.977 32.2%, 0.925 33.4%, 0.894 34.5%, 0.882 35.6%, 0.887 36.6%, 0.907 37.7%, 1.045 42.4%, 1.069 44.5%, 1.059 46.3%, 0.979 50.9%, 0.96 53.4%, 0.966 55.3%, 1.013 59.9%, 1.024 62.3%, 0.986 71.2%, 1.008 79.9%, 0.995 88.9%, 1);


  /* Apply the easing with a duration that fits the spring's complexity */
  /* MANDATORY: Always include a duration; linear() does not calculate it automatically */
  transition: scale 0.8s var(--spring-easing);
}

.spring:hover {
  scale: 1.2;
}
```
### Example: Bounce Easing

This example shows how to use a custom `linear()` function to create a bounce effect.

```css
.bounce {
  /* Define the physics-based easing as a reusable variable */
  --bounce-easing: linear(0, 0.214 14.7%, 0.386 23.7%, 0.598 31.9%, 0.999 44.7%, 0.807 52.6%, 0.762 56%, 0.747 59.4%, 0.758 62.4%, 0.793 65.6%, 0.999 77.4%, 0.961 81.2%, 0.949 84.8%, 0.956 88%, 0.993 95.5%, 1);


  /* Apply the easing with a duration that fits the bounce's complexity */
  /* MANDATORY: Always include a duration; linear() does not calculate it automatically */
  transition: scale 0.4s var(--bounce-easing);
}

.bounce:hover {
  scale: 1.2;
}
```

### Key Considerations

*   **Performance:** For the smoothest physics-based animations, apply `linear()` to properties that run on a separate thread, such as `transform` and `opacity`.
*   **Precision vs. Payload:** While more stops result in a smoother curve, they also increase the size of your CSS. Most generators allow you to "simplify" the curve to find the optimal balance between smoothness and code size.
*   **Avoid Opacity for Bounces:** Applying bounce easings to `opacity` can cause visually jarring flickering if the value overshoots below 0 or above 1.
*   **Accessibility:** Complex physics-based animations can be distracting or cause motion sensitivity for some users. Always respect user preferences by reducing or disabling these animations. Target the same selectors that set the transition (here `.spring` and `.bounce`), or the override does nothing.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .spring,
  .bounce {
    transition: none;
  }
}
```

### Fallback strategies

{{ BASELINE_STATUS("linear-easing") }}

`linear()` is Baseline Widely available, so it needs no fallback for that target, and no JavaScript animation library is needed to get spring or bounce curves. If your Baseline target includes older browsers (before Chrome 113, Firefox 112, or Safari 17.2), the fallbacks below give them a standard easing curve instead: the element still transitions, only without the overshoot.

#### CSS Fallback
For browsers that do not support `linear()`, provide a standard easing function as a fallback. The browser will ignore the `linear()` value if it doesn't recognize it, falling back to the previous valid declaration.

```css
.element {
  /* Fallback for older browsers (standard smooth exit) */
  transition: transform 0.8s ease-out;
  
  /* Modern browsers will override with the physics-based easing */
  transition-timing-function: linear(0, 1.1, 0.95, 1.02, 1);
}
```

This declaration-order fallback only works when `linear()` is written out literally. When the curve comes from a custom property, as in the examples above (`var(--spring-easing)`), the browser cannot reject the declaration at parse time: it becomes invalid at computed-value time and resets to the initial value (no transition at all) instead of falling back to the earlier declaration. In that case, use `@supports`:

```css
@supports not (transition-timing-function: linear(0, 1)) {
  .spring {
    /* Alternative experience for unsupported browsers */
    transition: scale 0.4s cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1);
  }
}
```

Place this rule before the `prefers-reduced-motion` override so the override still wins.
