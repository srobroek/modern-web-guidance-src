# Expectations for Passkey Registration

*   The implementation MUST load a webauthn-polyfills library. 
*   The "Create Passkey" button is gated on PublicKeyCredential.getClientCapabilities and hidden when conditional UI or passkey is unsupported.
*   The client invokes browser native passkey creation prompt upon clicking the button trigger.
*   The client decodes server creation options via parseCreationOptionsFromJSON before invoking the authenticator.
*   The client submits the resulting attestation to the verification endpoint as JSON-encoded credential data containing the credential id.
*   If the verification endpoint rejects the attestation with HTTP 400, signalUnknownCredential is triggered after feature-detecting it; it is not triggered after a network exception or a 5xx response.
