Judge relevance by whether that element or feature exists, not by whether the technique the expectation recommends is already used: an existing element that lacks the recommended technique is exactly what should be implemented and tested.';

# INPUTS
1. **Standard Guidance**: \`${opts.guideFile}\`
2. **Requirements**: \`${opts.expectationsFile}\`
3. **Golden Solution Diffs**:
${solutionList}
4. **Anti-Pattern Zero-Passrate Diff**: \`${opts.zeroPassratePatchFile}\` (must fail 100% of tests)
5. **Boilerplate Template**: \`${opts.templateFile}\`

# VERIFICATION & SCOPING RULES

## 1. Strictly Follow the Boilerplate Template
Base your grader's imports, workspace setup, helper function usage, and test structure on \`${opts.templateFile}\`. Use the template's helpers (\`getTargetFiles\`, \`getCssStyleSheet\`, \`getJsProject\`, \`getHtmlDocuments\`) to dynamically locate and analyze modified code across standalone files and embedded template tags. Never hardcode file paths.

## 2. Assertion Hierarchy
- **Static Analysis First**: Prioritize static AST analysis over browser execution for structural assertions. Always avoid regex on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
  - Use **Linkedom** for HTML structure and DOM querying (\`getHtmlDocuments\`).
  - Use **CSSOMNom** for CSS rules, at-rules (@media, @supports, @container, @view-transition), and declarations (\`getCssStyleSheet\`).
  - Use **ts-morph** for JavaScript/TypeScript syntax, AST analysis, and function/variable querying (\`getJsProject\`).
- **Browser Checks Only When Necessary**: Only write browser-based Playwright E2E tests when strictly necessary (for requirements that cannot be verified statically, such as runtime click events or dynamic state updates). Omit browser test blocks entirely if static checks are sufficient.
- **Reference Examples & API Definitions**: Before writing tests, use your file-viewing tools to inspect these reference pattern libraries and API type definitions for implementation patterns:
  - **Test Fixture Helper Signatures (Reference Only)**: [test-fixture.reference.ts](file://${opts.testFixtureReferencePath})
  - **Static Analysis Patterns (Linkedom, CSSOMNom, ts-morph)**: [parser-pattern-library.test.ts](file://${opts.parserPatternLibraryPath})
  - **Browser Analysis Patterns (Playwright)**: [playwright-pattern-library.grader.ts](file://${opts.playwrightPatternLibraryPath})
  - **TS Morph Type Definitions**: [ts-morph.d.ts](file://${opts.tsMorphDtsPath})
  - **Linkedom Type Definitions**: [linkedom.d.ts](file://${opts.linkedomDtsPath})
  - **CSSOMNom Type Definitions**: [cssomnom.d.ts](file://${opts.cssomnomDtsPath})

## 3. Granular Assertions: Single Assertion per Test
Write only one assertion per \`test('...', ...)\` block across both static and browser tests. Do not combine multiple assertions into a single test block. This ensures precise, unambiguous error reporting during calibration if a test fails.

## 4. Precision & Matching Rules
- **Outcome-Based Assertions**: Verify structural and functional requirements in static checks rather than forcing a single narrow implementation when valid alternatives exist.
- **Utility CSS Flexibility**: In apps using utility-first CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind), accept either standard CSS declarations (\`getCssStyleSheet\`) or equivalent utility classes on elements in template markup (\`getHtmlDocuments\`).
- **Flexible Pattern Matching**: Avoid exact-string equality for dynamic names or classes. Use loose matches, inclusion checks, and word boundaries (e.g., \`/\\bname\\b/\`) to avoid substring false positives.
- **No Swallowed Errors**: Do not wrap assertions in generic try/catch blocks that swallow exceptions.

## 5. Dependencies & Sandbox Constraints
Do not install any npm packages or execute application dev/build commands (like astro build or vite build) in your workspace. However, you MUST verify that your generated grader code compiles cleanly and passes linting. Run these verification commands in your workspace and fix any errors before ending your turn:
1. \`npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck --target esnext --module nodenext --moduleResolution nodenext --allowImportingTsExtensions --esModuleInterop grader.ts\`
2. \`npx oxlint grader.ts\`

Examine the codebase files of the web application \`${opts.baseApp}\` and read the \`description\` in the frontmatter of \`${opts.guideFile}\` to understand the ${target}.
Generate a \`${opts.taskFile}\` file containing exactly one realistic, high-level test prompt that a web developer would send to an AI coding assistant to apply the ${target} inside the application.

# INPUTS
1. **Standard Guidance**: \`${opts.guideFile}\`
2. **Target File Name**: \`${opts.taskFile}\`

# RULES
1. **Focus on the Guide Description**: The prompt must request the overall desired user outcome based specifically on the **description** in the frontmatter of \`${opts.guideFile}\`, keeping the request simple, high-level, and generic.
2. **No Technical/API Dictation**: Do NOT dictate the underlying technical implementation. NEVER name specific web platform APIs, framework features, or explicit CSS properties or functions (e.g. do NOT say "use @view-transition", "use active-view-transition-type", or "use pagereveal"). Describe the desired user outcomes instead.
3. **No Specific Details or Sub-Features**: Do NOT list or specify implementation details, custom sub-features, or edge cases (such as directional animations or accessibility preferences) that are not explicitly stated in the frontmatter description of \`${opts.guideFile}\`.
4. **Format**: Format \`${opts.taskFile}\` strictly as a single line prefixed with "- ", containing absolutely no internal line breaks.
5. **Casuality & Tone**: Write the prompt as a developer talking to an AI coding assistant.
6. **Directive Action Request**: Phrase the prompt as an ACTION REQUEST or directive (e.g., "implement X", "modify Y"). NEVER phrase it as an advisory question (e.g., "how can I?", "what's the best way to?") — the agent must implement, not just explain.
7. **No Fallbacks**: Do NOT mention or mandate legacy fallbacks in the prompt.
8. **No Internal Project References**: Do NOT name the guide itself or indicate that guidance exists.

   - \`patches/zero-passrate.patch\` (anti-pattern baseline)
   - \`patches/*-solution.patch\` (golden solution diffs)
4. **Evaluation Run Artifacts**: For each target, \`test-app-results/<target>/\` contains various artifacts, such as \`agent.patch\` (code changes generated by the agent), \`chat_log.txt\` (the agent's conversation log), etc.
5. **Target Evaluation Reports & Flags**:
${targetSections}

Note: \`${REPORT_FILE}\` is already seeded with each target's \`### Evaluation Results\` (copied directly from \`evals.md\`). Your task is to investigate the artifacts and fill in \`### Diagnostic Analysis & Actionable Recommendations\` under each target.

# SYSTEM WORKFLOW CONTEXT
To accurately diagnose failures, understand how \`gd dev\` generates and executes these components:
1. **Ground Truth**: \`${GUIDE_FILE}\` and \`${EXPECTATIONS_FILE}\` define the canonical, framework-agnostic implementation and must-pass requirements.
2. **Patches**: Golden solution diffs and the zero-passrate baseline are generated from \`${GUIDE_FILE}\` and \`${EXPECTATIONS_FILE}\`.
3. **Task Prompt**: \`task.md\` is generated from the \`description\` frontmatter of \`${GUIDE_FILE}\` and the target app's codebase.
4. **Grader**: \`grader.ts\` validates the requirements in \`${EXPECTATIONS_FILE}\` against the application workspace and is calibrated against the golden patches (must pass 100%) and zero-passrate patch (must fail 100%).
5. **Agent Evaluation Run**: The agent executes the \`task.md\` prompt against each target app without guidance (\`unguided\`) and with guidance (\`guided\`), and results are verified with \`grader.ts\`.

# ROOT-CAUSE DIAGNOSIS RULES (BY PRIMARY FLAG)

Diagnose each target according to its assigned flag:

1. **\`INFRASTRUCTURE_ERROR\`**:
   - The test run failed due to execution timeouts, agent CLI process crashes, rate limits (429), or missing setup files.
   - Explain the error context. No code file modifications are needed unless the issue stems from an invalid build/package configuration.

2. **\`MISSING_GUIDANCE_TOOL\`**:
   - The guided agent did not invoke \`modern-web-guidance\`.
   - **Diagnosis**: State that the test prompt in \`task.md\` failed to activate modern web guidance during the agent's run.
   - **Recommendation**: Recommend that the prompt in \`targets/<target>/task.md\` be revised so the desired user outcome in the target app more naturally triggers modern web guidance lookup.

3. **\`MISSING_EXPECTED_GUIDE\`**:
   - The guided agent invoked guidance tools, but \`${opts.guideName}\` was not among the consumed guides.
   - **Culprit**: \`targets/<target>/task.md\` or the \`description\` in \`${GUIDE_FILE}\`.
   - **Root Cause**: The prompt keywords failed to match the guide's indexing keywords or description frontmatter.
   - **Recommendation**: Provide concrete edits for \`targets/<target>/task.md\` or the frontmatter \`description\` in \`${GUIDE_FILE}\`.

4. **\`LOW_GUIDED_PASS_RATE\`**:
   - The guided agent pass rate is under 90%.
   - **Root Cause Investigation**: Review the failed assertions in \`${REPORT_FILE}\` and examine \`${GUIDE_FILE}\`, \`${EXPECTATIONS_FILE}\`, and \`targets/<target>/grader.ts\` to understand why the agent fell short. Consider:
     - **Grader Robustness (\`targets/<target>/grader.ts\`)**: Is the grader failing valid implementations due to overly rigid syntax checks, hardcoded selectors/names, or fragile AST queries?
     - **Guidance Quality (\`${GUIDE_FILE}\`)**: Does the guide lack essential modern web practices, clear syntax examples, fallback patterns, or common pitfalls?
     - **Expectations Alignment (\`${EXPECTATIONS_FILE}\`)**: Are the must-pass expectations ambiguous, conflicting, or missing key constraints?
     - **Miscellaneous Issues**: Any other issues discovered.
   - **Recommendation Rules**:
     - **Source-of-Truth Fixes**: If \`${GUIDE_FILE}\` or \`${EXPECTATIONS_FILE}\` needs changes, recommend modifications **ONLY** to those files and **DO NOT** recommend edits to any files in \`targets/\`. Always append:
       \`*(Note: After modifying source files, add the needs-eval-gen label to the PR to regenerate all target artifacts when running gd dev-gap)*\`
     - **Grader Fixes**: When grader fixes are necessary, only recommend direct edits to \`targets/<target>/grader.ts\` if \`${GUIDE_FILE}\` and \`${EXPECTATIONS_FILE}\` require **NO** changes. Always append:
       \`*(Note: After modifying target files, add the needs-eval-run label to the PR to re-run evaluations when running gd dev-gap)*\`
     - **Miscellaneous Fixes**: Any other recommended fixes (do not have to be file-specific).

5. **\`HEALTHY\`**:
   - The target achieved ≥ 90% guided pass rate with all guidance tools and guides correctly consumed.
   - **No investigation or fixes needed**: State that the target is healthy, guidance was consumed as expected, and all assertions passed.
   - **Actionable Recommendations**: Output \`- None (target is healthy and verified).\`

# REPORT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

For each target in \`${REPORT_FILE}\`, complete the diagnostic section matching this structure. Whenever recommending a change to a file (\`${GUIDE_FILE}\`, \`${EXPECTATIONS_FILE}\`, \`targets/<target>/task.md\`, or \`targets/<target>/grader.ts\`), include a fenced \`diff\` block directly beneath that bullet showing the exact lines to remove (\`-\`) and add (\`+\`) so reviewers can see and apply the concrete suggestion:
