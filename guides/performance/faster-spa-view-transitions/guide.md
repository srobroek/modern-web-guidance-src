# Faster SPA View Transitions via State Caching

Enable instant navigation between views in a Single-Page Application (SPA) by caching the rendered state of inactive views instead of destroying them.

## Overview

Traditionally, when a user navigates between tabs or views in an SPA, developers either destroy the old view or hide it using `display: none`. Both approaches require the browser to recreate or recalculate the full layout and paint when the user returns to that view.

By using `content-visibility: hidden` on inactive views, the browser removes the element’s contents from the layout flow and stops painting it, but *retains* its cached rendering state in memory. When the user switches back, the view restores nearly instantly.

### The CPU vs. RAM Trade-off

While this approach offers massive performance benefits, it introduces a specific trade-off that you must manage carefully:

*   **CPU Savings:** Massive. The browser completely skips layout and paint passes for hidden views.
*   **RAM Cost:** High. The browser keeps all DOM nodes, event listeners, and state for the hidden view in memory.
*   **Script keeps running:** `content-visibility: hidden` only skips rendering. Timers, `requestAnimationFrame` loops, intervals, and network polling started by a hidden view keep running. Pause them when the view becomes inactive and resume them when it is shown again.

#### When This Trade-off Becomes Dangerous

*   **DO** use this strategy for simple applications with a small, predictable number of views (e.g., a 3-to-5 tabbed interface).
*   **DO NOT** unconditionally cache every view in highly dynamic applications that generate dozens of unique reports or use infinite dynamic routes. Doing so will eventually cause severe memory bloat and may crash the browser on low-end devices.
*   **MANDATORY:** If your application is highly dynamic, you MUST implement an **eviction strategy** (like a Least Recently Used cache) to destroy old views when a memory threshold is reached.

## Implementation

### 1. Configure View Containers

Set `content-visibility: hidden` on views that are not currently active.

> **Note:** The `content-visibility: hidden` property hides an element's *contents*, but the element itself remains styled and visible. Its background, borders, padding, and margins will still be painted by the browser.

```css
.spa-view.inactive {
  /* MANDATORY: Use hidden to cache the rendering state of inactive views */
  content-visibility: hidden;
  
  /* Optional: Prevent hidden views from taking up physical space in layout flow */
  position: absolute;
}
```

### 2. Manage Focus

When swapping views, ensure you manage keyboard focus correctly to preserve accessibility. A plain `<div>` or `<section>` is not focusable, so `focus()` on it does nothing. Give the focus target `tabindex="-1"` (focusable from script, but not added to the tab order), for example the view's main heading:

```html
<section id="settings" class="spa-view inactive" aria-hidden="true">
  <h2 tabindex="-1">Settings</h2>
  <!-- view content -->
</section>
```

```javascript
function switchToView(viewId) {
  // Hide all views
  document.querySelectorAll('.spa-view').forEach(view => {
    view.classList.add('inactive');
    view.setAttribute('aria-hidden', 'true');
  });

  // Show the target view
  const activeView = document.getElementById(viewId);
  activeView.classList.remove('inactive');
  activeView.removeAttribute('aria-hidden');

  // MANDATORY: Move focus into the new view to ensure a logical tab order.
  // The target needs tabindex="-1" (or must be natively focusable).
  const focusTarget = activeView.querySelector('[tabindex="-1"]') ?? activeView;
  focusTarget.focus();
}
```

### Fallback strategies

{{ BASELINE_STATUS("content-visibility") }}

The `content-visibility` property degrades gracefully. In browsers that do not support it:
*   The property is ignored.
*   To prevent fallback browsers from rendering all views simultaneously, you should provide a fallback to `display: none` in your CSS:

```css
@supports not (content-visibility: hidden) {
  .spa-view.inactive {
    display: none;
  }
}
```
