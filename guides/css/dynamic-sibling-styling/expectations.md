* The implementation uses `sibling-index()` and `sibling-count()` to calculate visual properties.
* A fallback strategy is provided for browsers that do not support these native functions.
* The fallback uses JavaScript to inject `--sibling-index` and `--sibling-count` custom properties.
* The JavaScript fallback is conditionally executed using a `CSS.supports()` check (e.g., `CSS.supports('top: calc(sibling-index() * 1px)')`).
* The injected `--sibling-index` value is 1-based (starts at 1, not 0).
* The CSS is structured to use the custom property variables as a base and then override them with the native functions inside an `@supports` block.
* The implementation uses `sibling-count()` to calculate proportions or distributions (e.g., for the color spectrum).
* The implementation uses the total count to find the midpoint for a symmetrical effect (like a fan).
* The implementation combines sibling functions with CSS trigonometry (`sin()`, `cos()`) for circular positioning.
* The JavaScript fallback computes `--sibling-index` and `--sibling-count` per parent element from all element children (as the native functions do), not from a document-wide list.
