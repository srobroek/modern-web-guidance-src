# Overflow Clipping Control

While `overflow: hidden` is a "blunt instrument" that almost always clips content strictly at the padding-box, `overflow: clip` combined with `overflow-clip-margin` provides the "scalpel" for fine-grained layout control across block containers.

Specify exactly where clipping occurs with `overflow: clip` and `overflow-clip-margin`. You can align the boundary precisely with inner box-model edges or extend the clipping boundary beyond the element's box by a specified offset (a safety margin). This modern approach is highly performant and eliminates the legacy requirement of adding extra wrapper containers with custom padding and negative margins just to let visual effects (like prominent child element shadows) render unclipped.

Replaced elements (`<img>`, `<video>`, `<canvas>`, etc.) default to `overflow: clip` and `overflow-clip-margin: content-box`, giving you control to cleanly contain images that use `object-fit` or `border-radius`. 

## How to Implement

1. **Apply `overflow: clip`**: Ensure the target element has `overflow: clip` enabled. Setting `overflow: clip` is **mandatory** on block layout containers for `overflow-clip-margin` to take effect. If `overflow` is set to `hidden`, `auto`, or `scroll`, the `overflow-clip-margin` property is ignored by the browser. `overflow: clip` prevents all scrolling (both user-initiated and programmatic via JavaScript).
2. **Align to a Box-Edge**: Use keywords to precisely align the clipping boundary to inner box-model edges:
   - `content-box`: Clips content exactly where the content area begins, leaving the padding area completely clean. Content stops right at the padding's edge. Excellent for nested layout modules.
   - `padding-box` (Default): Clips content at the inner edge of the border.
   - `border-box`: Clips content at the outer edge of the border, allowing content to sit under or partially overlap a translucent border.
3. **Define a Specified Offset (The Bleed)**: Provide a length value (e.g., `15px` or `5px`) to create a safety zone before cutting pixels. This allows prominent child element shadows to render unclipped past the boundary edge without expanding layout geometry.
4. **Combine Box-Edge and Offset**: Specify both a box edge and a length offset simultaneously (e.g., `content-box 15px`) to offset from a specific box edge.

## Example Code

The following examples demonstrate dynamic container layout controls, showcasing automated inner content curve nested framing and child element shadow protection alongside progressive enhancement fallbacks.

### Block Containers: Nested Rounded Curves

* Apply `overflow-clip-margin: content-box` to a parent container with rounded corners and custom padding.
* Apply similar rounded corners on inner child media and footer components along the concentric inner content box boundary, solving awkward nesting curves without custom `calc()` logic.

```html
<div class="nested-curve-parent">
  <img src="avatar.jpg" alt="Nested Curve Demo">
  <div class="nested-curve-footer">Card Footer</div>
</div>
```

```css
/**
 * Standard block layout container with outer corner radii and padding.
 * Keeps base level 1 fallback clipping roughly at the inner padding box.
 */
.nested-curve-parent {
  /* The geometry the concentric clip is derived from: 24px outer radius minus 12px padding = 12px inner radius */
  border-radius: 24px;
  padding: 12px;
  background: #f4f4f4;
  /* Level 1 Fallback: clips child roughly at the padding box */
  overflow: hidden;
}

.nested-curve-parent img {
  display: block;
  inline-size: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}

/* Inner footer component: no radius of its own; the content-box clip rounds its outer corners to 12px */
.nested-curve-footer {
  background: #111;
  color: #fff;
}

@supports (overflow-clip-margin: content-box) {
  .nested-curve-parent {
    /* MANDATORY: overflow: clip is required on non-replaced elements */
    overflow: clip;
    /* Automatically curves clipping edge to match inner content-box radius */
    overflow-clip-margin: content-box;
  }
}
```

### Block Containers: Child Element Shadow Bleed

* Apply `overflow: clip` and define an extended `overflow-clip-margin` length offset to create a visible safety zone permitting the child's shadow to render unclipped outside the parent container without altering layout geometry. Without this, the child's shadow is clipped at the parent's boundary.

```html
<div class="safety-zone-parent">
  <h4>Clipped Container</h4>
  <p>Inner content boundaries safely contained.</p>
  <!-- Child button element positioned inside with a prominent shadow -->
  <button class="demo-glowing-btn">Submit</button>
</div>
```

```css
/**
 * Standard block layout container clipping inner content.
 * Base fallback uses overflow: hidden, which abruptly slices child element shadows.
 */
.safety-zone-parent {
  /* Level 1 Fallback: clips overflowing content but truncates child shadows */
  overflow: hidden;
}

/* Child button element positioned inside with an expanded shadow */
.demo-glowing-btn {
  display: block;
  box-shadow: 0 8px 13px rgba(229, 46, 113, 0.7);
}

@supports (overflow-clip-margin: 15px) {
  .safety-zone-parent {
    overflow: clip;
    /* Establishes a visible safety zone allowing child element shadows to render safely outside */
    overflow-clip-margin: 15px;
  }
}
```

## Strategic Implementation & Best Practices

- **DO** apply `overflow: clip` on target elements when utilizing `overflow-clip-margin`, as setting `overflow` strictly to `clip` is **mandatory** on standard block layout containers to activate custom or inner curved clip margins.
- **DO** set `overflow-clip-margin: content-box` on padded containers with rounded corners to automatically clip unrounded internal child elements into mathematically perfect nested border curves without manual padding subtraction logic.
- **DO** configure `overflow-clip-margin` with a specified length offset when applying external visual effects (like `filter: drop-shadow()`) to prevent sharp bounding box truncation without altering or expanding layout geometry.
- **DO NOT** apply `overflow: clip` to an element that must scroll, by the user or programmatically via JavaScript, as `clip` completely disables scrolling.
- **DO** prefer `overflow: clip` over `overflow: hidden` on ancestors of `position: sticky` elements. `hidden` makes the ancestor a scroll container, so the sticky element sticks to that non-scrolling box and never sticks while the page scrolls; `clip` does not create a scroll container, so the sticky element keeps using the nearest real scroller.

## Fallback Strategies

{{ BASELINE_STATUS("overflow-clip") }}
{{ BASELINE_STATUS("overflow-clip-margin") }}

Chrome and Edge support `overflow-clip-margin` (lengths since 90, box-edge keywords since 104) but only when **both** axes use `overflow: clip`; the status above treats that partial implementation as unsupported. Use the `overflow: clip` shorthand, as the examples do, rather than `overflow-x: clip` alone. Safari does not support `overflow-clip-margin`.

For target environments lacking native support for `overflow: clip` or `overflow-clip-margin`, progressive enhancement fallback strategies depend directly on the visual intent, as the examples above show:
- Fallback to `overflow: hidden` as the base experience to guarantee core boundaries are maintained.
- Fallback to `overflow: visible` on elements where drop-shadows or external corner badges must not be truncated.
