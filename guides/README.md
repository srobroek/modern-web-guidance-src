# Authoring and Testing Guides

This README details how to use the `gd` CLI to test and calibrate your guides as they progress through the 3-stage workflow.

**Prerequisite Setup:**
Before using the `gd` CLI, ensure it's linked globally:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm link --global && gd setup-completion
```
*Note: For the auto-completion to take effect, you must refresh your shell (e.g., open a new terminal or source your config).*

### Stage 3 Pipeline: `gd dev`

Once you reach **Stage 3 (Needs evals)**—meaning `guide.md` and `expectations.md` are completely written—you can use `gd dev` to automatically generate all evaluation artifacts, calibrate graders, run evaluations, and generate an evaluation diagnostic report in one command:

```bash
gd dev <path/to/guide_dir>

# e.g. gd dev guides/css/size-aware-styling
```

This will automatically execute the 5-step pipeline:
1. **Solutions Generation**: Generates golden solution patches and zero-passrate baseline patches across target base applications (`daily-grind`, `devtools-times`).
2. **Grader Generation**: Generates `grader.ts` Playwright tests based on `expectations.md` and your guide.
3. **Grader Calibration**: Calibrates the grader (ensures golden patches pass 100% and zero-passrate baseline fails 100%).
4. **Agent Evaluations**: Executes guided and unguided agent runs against the target apps to measure pass rates and guidance tool consumption.
5. **Evaluation Report (`report.md`)**: Invokes an evaluator agent to analyze failed assertions, diagnose root causes, and output actionable recommendations into `<guide_dir>/test-app-results/report.md`.

To skip agent evaluations and report generation after calibration, add `--no-test`:

```bash
gd dev <path/to/guide_dir> --no-test
```

To run against specific target base app(s) (single or comma-separated) instead of all targets:

```bash
gd dev <path/to/guide_dir> --targets daily-grind
gd dev <path/to/guide_dir> --targets daily-grind,devtools-times
```

### Submitting a Pull Request: `gd pr`

Once `gd dev` completes and generates `test-app-results/report.md`, you can create a Pull Request directly from your terminal:

```bash
gd pr <path/to/guide_dir>

# e.g. gd pr guides/css/size-aware-styling
```

This will automatically:
1. Create and switch to a feature branch (`gd-dev/<guide-name>`) if currently on `main`.
2. Stage and commit any uncommitted changes for the target guide directory.
3. Push your feature branch to `origin`.
4. Analyze `report.md` to automatically detect and apply PR labels:
   - **`gd-dev-content`**: Attached if recommendations include modifications to `guide.md` or `expectations.md`.
   - **`gd-dev-eval`**: Attached if recommendations include modifications to `task.md` or `grader.ts`.
5. Open a new Pull Request (or update the existing PR description and sync labels if an open PR already exists for the branch) with the full evaluation report (`report.md`) as the PR body description. If an open `eval-gap` issue exists for the guide, `gd pr` appends `Closes https://github.com/GoogleChrome/modern-web-guidance-src/issues/<number>` so the issue closes automatically when the PR merges. When updating an existing PR, any `needs-eval-gen` or `needs-eval-run` trigger labels are automatically removed. It refuses to push a branch that still contains the commits of an already merged or closed PR; switch to a new branch off `main` instead.

### Fixing Open Eval Gaps & Updating PRs: `gd dev-gap`

`eval-gap-watch` files an "Evals missing for the \<guide-name\> guide" issue (label `eval-gap`) for each guide that needs evals. `gd dev-gap` works through those issues—as well as existing `gd pr` Pull Requests labeled for re-evaluation—running `gd dev` and `gd pr` for each guide in turn.

```bash
gd dev-gap --dry-run                # show which guides/PRs would run and why the rest are skipped
gd dev-gap --limit 1                # process at most one guide
gd dev-gap --targets daily-grind    # run only for specific target base app(s)
gd dev-gap                          # process all of them across all targets
```

Run it from a clean, up-to-date `main`. For each new gap, it runs `gd dev`, opens a PR from a fresh `gd-dev/<guide-name>` branch (linking the `eval-gap` issue with `Closes <issue-url>`), then returns to `main` and deletes the local branch. If a guide fails, its changes are discarded and the batch moves on; it stops only if it can't get back to a clean `main`.

#### Re-running `gd dev-gap` on Open PRs (`needs-eval-gen` & `needs-eval-run`)

After reviewers or authors push fixes to an open `gd pr` Pull Request, add one of the following labels to the PR so the next `gd dev-gap` run picks it up:
- **`needs-eval-gen`**: Use when `guide.md` or `expectations.md` was updated. `gd dev-gap` fetches and checks out the PR branch, merges the latest `main`, deletes the targeted `targets/<app>` directory(s), and runs `gd dev` and `gd pr` to regenerate all target artifacts from scratch. (Takes precedence if both labels are present.)
- **`needs-eval-run`**: Use when `targets/<app>/grader.ts` or `targets/<app>/task.md` was updated. `gd dev-gap` fetches and checks out the PR branch, merges the latest `main`, and runs `gd dev` and `gd pr` without deleting `targets/`, re-calibrating and re-running the evaluation against the existing target files.

Once `gd pr` updates the PR, `needs-eval-gen` and `needs-eval-run` are automatically removed. Unlabeled open `grader updates: <guide-name>` PRs and guides with leftover `gd-dev/<guide-name>` branches without an open PR are skipped.

### Checking Status: `gd audit`

You can use `gd audit` to see exactly where every guide sits in the Kanban board pipeline:

```bash
gd audit
```

This will output a categorized table sorted into the 6 maturity stages (`Stub`, `Incomplete`, `Needs expectations`, `Needs calibration`, `Needs test`, `Eval-ready`), along with recommended next steps.

### Manual Piece-wise execution

Occasionally, you may want to generate or test specific pieces of the pipeline manually.
Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_MODEL` environment variables are in `modern-web-guidance-src/.env`:

```sh
GEMINI_API_KEY=api-key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.1-pro-preview
```

Setup Playwright before testing:
```sh
pnpm install
pnpm setup:playwright
```

Generate *only* the negative demo:
```bash
gd dev <path/to/guide_dir> --gen-negative
```

Generate *only* the grader:
```bash
gd dev <path/to/guide_dir> --gen-grader
```

6. Once the grader is generated, run it on the `demo.html` and `negative-demo.html` with:
```bash
gd dev <path/to/demo_file> --grade

# e.g. gd dev guides/performance/content-vis/demo.html --grade
# e.g. gd dev guides/performance/content-vis/negative-demo.html --grade
```

On each `gd grade` run, a `grade-report` folder will be created in the same directory as the specified demo file, and the results will be displayed in a browser window.

If you pass the **guide directory**, it will run a rapid meta-calibration suite to ensure the grader correctly passes `demo.html` at 100% and correctly fails `negative-demo.html` at 0%. If the grader fails either constraint, it will output a CLI summary and provide copy-paste links directly to the generated HTML reports so you can explore in detail.


You can automatically verify that your grader is perfectly calibrated against both of these files by running:

```bash
gd dev <path/to/guide_dir> --test-grader

# e.g. gd dev guides/performance/content-vis --test-grader
```

## Testing with an Agent

### Automated (Recommended)

By default, `gd dev` runs a full agent evaluation after calibration:

```bash
gd dev <path/to/guide_dir>
```

This runs the following pipeline after the grader calibrates successfully:

1. **Generate `tasks/task.md`** if missing — uses the default solution agent (Antigravity CLI, or Jetski CLI with `GD_DEV_USE_JETSKI=1`) to create a set of developer-facing prompts derived from the guide and adds `base_app: daily-grind` frontmatter.
2. **Grade the base app as-is** (pre-score) — establishes a baseline before any agent runs
3. **Run the agent** in both `unguided` (no guide access) and `guided` (with guidance access) modes against the base app
4. **Grade both outputs** and print a comparison:

```
Agent test results:
  Base app (pre):   1/9 checks passed (11%)
  Unguided:         3/9 checks passed (33%)
  Guided:           8/9 checks passed (89%)
  Guide impact:     +56% (vs unguided)
```

The agent is selected from the `config.ts` if it exists (see [config.ts.example](../config.ts.example) for setup), otherwise uses the configured default in [harness config](../harness/config.ts) and `gd dev`.
The base app is selected from the generated `tasks/task.md` file (which defaults to `daily-grind`).

### Negative Evals

To verify that guides improve agent performance starting from a "bad" implementation, you can run against the `negative-demo.html`.

```bash
gd eval <guideName>/negative
```

### Manual Steps

If you need more control, you can run each step individually:

1. Configure the following settings for your run in the [harness config](../harness/config.ts):

```
skillsToEnable: ['modern-web-guidance'],
agent: Agents.GEMINI_CLI
```

> Note: to test the agent without any guide access, set `skillsToEnable` to `[]` (and step `2` can be skipped).

2. Build the guide index with the guide:

```sh
pnpm build:guides <path/to/guide_dir>
```

3. Create a `test-app` directory in the `<guide_dir>`:

```sh
mkdir <path/to/guide_dir>/test-app/
```

Within this folder, create a base app (e.g. `index.html`) that you want the agent to modify (or, leave the folder empty for a completely blank slate).

4. Run the agent on the test app with a prompt:

```bash
gd run <path/to/guide_dir>/test-app/ "<prompt>"
```

This will create a `test-app-result` directory in the `<path/to/guide_dir>` folder with the results of the run.

5. Run the grader and see the results on the generated file:

```bash
gd dev <path/to/guide_dir>/test-app-result/index.html --grade
```

Use the results to validate guide quality, and make changes as needed. A useful sanity check is to examine the result of the agent run *without* guide access.
