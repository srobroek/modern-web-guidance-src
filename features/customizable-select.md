## Usage

- Test layout behavior. Setting `appearance: base-select` removes the default browser behavior of sizing the select based on its longest option width. You may need to set a fixed width or use flex/grid constraints to prevent layout shifts.
- Ensure your `<select>` has a `name` attribute and an associated `<label>`. This ensures that even with a custom UI, the component remains accessible to screen readers and works correctly with standard form submissions.
- Use standard `value` attributes on options to ensure form submission works exactly as before.

## Fallbacks

For browsers that do not yet support `appearance: base-select`, the `<select>` element degrades gracefully to a standard operating system dropdown.

- **Non-Text Content Ignored**: Older browsers strip HTML tags (like `<svg>` or `<div>`) inside `<option>` tags and render only the text nodes. Ensure the text content of the `<option>` is readable and meaningful on its own.
- **HTML Structure Handling**: Standard parsers may ignore the `<button>` and `<selectedcontent>` tags inside `<select>` or treat them as invalid. No heavy JavaScript polyfills are strictly required for progressive enhancement if you view standard text as a readable fallback.
- **Script Gating**: No script is needed for the fallback itself. If you add JavaScript that depends on the customizable select, run it only when `CSS.supports("appearance", "base-select")` returns `true`.
