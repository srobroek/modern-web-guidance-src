# `color-scheme` property

## Issues

- Chrome and Firefox respect `color-scheme` for iframes: they render embedded pages in the correct color scheme and adjust the embedded page's `prefers-color-scheme` media query to reflect the embedding context's `color-scheme`. Safari does not, and resolves `prefers-color-scheme` to the system setting even inside iframes.
  - **If you control both parent and iframe:** pass the parent's color scheme to the iframe explicitly — via a URL parameter (`?theme=dark`) at iframe construction time, or via `postMessage()` (which also lets you react to runtime changes). In the iframe, set a class on `<html>` (and/or `color-scheme` on `:root`) from that signal instead of relying on `prefers-color-scheme`.
  - **If you only control the embedded page:** there is no reliable way to detect the embedding context's `color-scheme` from inside the iframe in Safari. Expose an explicit theme parameter on your embed API (e.g. a query string or `postMessage` protocol) and document it for embedders.

## Fallbacks

The `color-scheme` property is **progressive enhancement**.
Browsers that do not support it will ignore this property and use their default light-mode UI.

To adapt to the user's preferences in older browsers, use `prefers-color-scheme` media queries to provide different colors when dark mode is preferred.

- DO use the media query to switch custom properties on `:root` or `html`
- Avoid using the media query on individual components unless the component requires a very specific type of dark mode customization beyond colors.

```css
:root {
  /* Define brand colors for each mode */
  --color-brand-light: #0056b3;
  --color-brand-dark: #00e5ff;
  --color-brand: var(--color-brand-light);

  /* Ignored in older browsers */
  color-scheme: light dark;
}

/* MANDATORY: Fallback for browsers without light-dark support.
   Keep it at the top level: browsers that need this fallback may not support CSS nesting. */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --color-brand: var(--color-brand-dark);
  }
}

button.primary {
	background-color: var(--color-brand);
}
```
